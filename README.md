# Module 1 Final Project

## Microsoft Video Content


## The Project

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.
Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.

# Should Microsoft Make a Movie?

Although the popularity of TV Series has exponentially grown over the last decade, movies still represent a more lucrative investment. A single film has the potential to make hundreds of millions of dollars in the box office alone over a few months, while a series takes a longer commitment to breakeven. Even a series such as Game of Thrones, which earned $3.1 billion over 8 seasons (8 years), Avatar the movie earned $2.79 billion in the box office alone (1 year). 

# The Data

You may scrape or make API calls to get additional data, but included in the repository (in the folder `zippedData`) is some movie-related data from:
* Box Office Mojo: gross revenue data
* IMDB: year, region, genre, director, producer, data
* OMDB API: for genre data

# Summary

Reviewing the last 10 years of movie data (longer than 80 minute duration), both Disney and Marvel films have consistently outperformed other productions. It is clear that a Marvel movie, ranked good or bad, will land in the top 10 highest grossing movie for the year. The data shows that production company, such as Marvel and/or Disney, is highly correlated with movie revenue along with production budget. However, this does not prove causation. In other words, Marvel comics may be the cause of popularity and happen to have the means for greater production budget or high spend in production budge by Marvel increases popularity of said movies. 

Movie goers these days are interested in action and adventure movies, specifically superheroes. What does this mean for Microsoft? That their best bet to testing out the movie industry would be to invest in a hero. Creating a partnership with Marvel would give Microsoft the ability to pluck a superhero from their comic repotoir. Or Microsoft could come up with their own hero marketed to the millenial and gen Z streamers.
